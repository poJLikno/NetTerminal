# NetTerminal
#### Get remote access to others devices connected to same network!

**Attention!** During execution creates "buffer_file.txt" with commands' result.

## Supported platforms:
* Windows
* MacOS X
* Unix-like OS

## App has 2 modes:
- [x] Server
	- Use `$ NetTerminal` to start server & wait client connection.
- [x] Client
	- Use `$ NetTerminal [ip] [port]` to connect to server in same network.

## Some problems
Some commands aren't supported by NetTerminal, 'cause commands' result saves with `[command] > buffer_file.txt`.
